# RFC 0008: Emoprinting

**Status**: Draft  
**Author**: Anna Popivanova  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Tags**: emoprinting, behavioral-fingerprint, identity-continuity, affective-trace, agent-characterization, runtime-verification, behavioral telemetry

---

## Motivation
Traditional identity verification focuses on static fingerprints and cryptographic attestations. But agents also exhibit behavioral signatures - patterns of interaction, linguistic style, decision heuristics, and affective tone. Emoprinting captures these traits as a dynamic, verifiable layer of identity. It enables continuity across sessions, detection of impersonation, and richer trust modeling.

---

## Goals
 - Define a behavioral fingerprint schema for agents  
 - Capture affective, linguistic, and interactional traits  
 - Support runtime emoprint verification and drift detection  
 - Enable continuity and personality anchoring across environments

---

## Emoprint Schema

```json
{
  "agent_id": "airlock:agent:sha256:abc123...",
  "emoprint_id": "airlock:emoprint:sha256:def456...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T15:30:00Z",
  "traits": {
    "linguistic_style": "formal",
    "affective_tone": "warm",
    "response_latency": "low",
    "decision_bias": "risk-averse",
    "interaction_pattern": "turn-based"
  },
  "source": {
    "session_id": "airlock:session:xyz789...",
    "environment_id": "airlock:env:sha256:env456..."
  },
  "signature": "ed25519:..."
}
```

---

## Verification Logic
 - **agent_id** must match a known fingerprint (RFC 0002)
 - **traits** must be consistent with historical emoprints
 - **source.session_id** must be valid and active
 - **signature** must match agent’s public key
 - **drift detection flags** significant deviation from prior emoprints

---

## Continuity & Drift
Agents may evolve, but abrupt changes in emoprint traits may signal:
 - Impersonation
 - Environment tampering
 - Model corruption or retraining

Drift thresholds are configurable per deployment. Emoprint continuity supports:
 - Session linking
 - Personality anchoring
 - Behavioral lineage tracking

---

## Integration Points
 - **Audit Tokens (RFC 0004)**: Emoprints may be embedded or referenced
 - **Trust Graphs (RFC 0007)**: Behavioral similarity may influence edge weights
 - **Verification Modes (RFC 0006)**: Emoprint checks may be optional, strict, or adaptive

---

## Threat Vectors
 - **Style mimicry** — mitigated via multi-trait verification
 - **Session hijacking** — mitigated via source linkage and timestamp checks
 - **Drift masking** — mitigated via cumulative deviation scoring
 - **Behavioral spoofing** — mitigated via attestation cross-checks
